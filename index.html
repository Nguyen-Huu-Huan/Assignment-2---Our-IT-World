              <h3>Ideal Teammates Characteristics with Personality and Learning Test Reflections</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Working Attitude:</mark> I would love to see my future teammate's eagerness to do work and I want him/her to always be active for social communication and work discussion. Moreover, IT is not just for
                  genius coders who can implement all the complex functionalities, as a visual-preferred learner (as reflected in the <strong>Learning Style Test</strong>), I think IT is also for designers who can turn those abstract functionalities
                  into user-friendly platforms. Therefore, I would like to have at least one teammate who is/are willing to try new design ideas with sample prototypes or visualizations and freely propose them to the group if the teammate thinks that
                  will improve the User Experience.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Personality:</mark> An ideal teammate treats other group members with politeness, courtesy, and respect. He or she is expected to be an active listener and knowledge sharer who listens and shares his or
                  her knowledge to other teammates whenever possible. Having a 58% of being an introvert (in the <strong>Myers-Briggs Test</strong> result), I would love to have teammates who are open-minded to my ideas and expressions. Otherwise, it
                  would be difficult for me to effectively work with them.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Skills:</mark> As an imaginative guy (with 0% "realistic" in the scale of the <strong>TypeFinder Personality Test</strong>), I find it hard to properly organize my ideas in a comprehensive way. Therefore,
                  I want to have at least one teammate who excel at writing skill to reform my words and ideas into meaningful sentences.</li>

            <li>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;I will use the abbreviation BITAI which is a combination of Bitcoin and AI to name the project. BITAI will center around building multiple machine learning models at a time to predict the up and down falls of Bitcoin so
                as to plan out an effective investment strategy for our target customers (i.e., Bitcoin Investors).
                Each model has a score determined/calculated by several standardized metrics to help users choose the best available algorithm option. In addition to that, BITAI also uses the Artificial Intelligence technology to detect important
                events gathered from global news in different fields, and turn them into parameters which will affect the final score. BITAI will initially release a beta version which is implemented as a computer application users to experience.
                Users' feedbacks in this initial phase help me improve the quality of the project before scaling it up. When all the conditions are met, I will scale it up to mobile and web platforms and then the cloud (if possible).</p>

              <div class="row-no-justify" style="flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around;">
                <p class="col-45 idea1-original idea2-original">&emsp;&emsp;Bitcoin has been one of the hottest digital coins for citizens around the world ever since it was born. In fact, according to Daniel Coil's article, Bitcoin possesses up to
                  60% share of the crypto market <a href="#idea1-destination"><code class="text-bold">[1]</code></a>. No wonder the majority of investors revels in this crypto coin; its secured trading mechanism and volume of transactions indeed
                  allow many long-term users to benefit from
                  without worrying about risks regarding cybersecurity. Acknowledging the worldwide trend of Bitcoin with more than 100 million "in-house" investors <a href="#idea2-destination"><code class="text-bold">[2]</code></a>, I would like to
                  help a portion of this huge market of users to achieve higher profit
                  rates and better futures.</p>

              </div>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;Since traditional investment strategies (i.e., using chart visualizations for making decisions) have been a risky gamble in this harsh and bleak competition, I want to use a different investment approach to differentiate
                myself from the majority. Fortunately, with the help of AI and machine learning, I can build several tech-based models to scientifically and automatically forecast the Bitcoin marketplace to get a higher chance of profitable
                investments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Description</h3>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;The project is a GUI-based application which has many algorithms implemented for predicting the Bitcoin market. It will have:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Dashboard:</mark> to feature which algorithm has the highest score using metrics from machine learning.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Subscription Plan:</mark> By default, the app only supports Bitcoin with a limited trial period (e.g., 1 month) for users to experience a narrow set of features, when users' demands for other digital
                  coins increase, they can go for a subscription plan that allows them to have access to more cryptocurrencies in the market such as Binance, eToro, Ethereum and so forth.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Extra Back-end Algorithm:</mark> During the process of making this application, I would like to implement an extra algorithm to update and convert the world news into considerations before showing the
                  recommendation results. In that way, the app will guarantee users zero to little loss investment. This feature is only available for users who have a subscription plan.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Cash Out Methods:</mark> This feature will allow users to conveniently convert their Bitcoin and other coins available in their digital wallet to money and the money will be transacted directly to their
                  bank account. For clarity, I will add a Currency Converter section for users to get more information about the conversion rate. The application will charge users commission fees based on their volume of transaction and the amount of
                  fees will be determined by their subscription plan.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Auto Investment: </mark> This handy feature may become the most valuable feature as it will help save a lot of traditional investors who have to spend days and nights hunting for their ideal trades. It
                  will have a default minimum budget of 3000$ worth of Bitcoin and a maximum budget threshold specified by users. In addition, if specified, users can choose for themselves the loss limit to rest assured the application does not empty
                  out their wallets when it malfunctions. IT Professionals can config this feature to their needs such as modify default investment strategy, maximum amount of budget per trade and so on.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">User Interface:</mark> Users can go to setting, set their favorite application themes and customize the application appearance as they wish. By default, the app will support light, dark, solar, and
                  material themes for users.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Crypto Request & Feedback:</mark> Acknowledging that there are so many existing coins and newborn coins in the market, I want to add more coins to the system using the help of users' requests. If this
                  application trading strategy is not applicable to certain coins, users can report this to let the owners know what to adjust. Moreover, feedback regarding functionality requests or user interface recommendations are welcome in this
                  section.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Cashback Policy:</mark> For VIP/Subscribed clients, this feature allows them to make request for a percentage of cash return for their trading loss. Users will have to show proofs of trading using the app
                  service to become eligible for money return.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Donate:</mark> User can take part of their profit gained from the app to donate and support the project. Part of the users' donations will be used for charity and environment associations.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Report & Statistics:</mark> Charts and statistics regarding profit will be shown to users. This section will be detailed with a variety of chart types and short reports to help users visualize their
                  investment status. Users are allowed to customize the chart to view different perspectives of it like view by hour, day, month, year, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;I will use C# (an object-oriented programming language) to create a GUI for BITAI. Afterwards, I will use Beautiful Soup to crawl data from the Bitcoin websites, feed these data to TensorFlow or Keras to work with the
                machine learning algorithms. During the algorithm building process, I want to leverage AI's power to work with world news (including innovations, politics, technological advance, etc.), turn these news into the algorithms'
                considerations so as to optimize the investment strategies before showing the prediction results. Although these tools require many years of education, I still have a great passion for it due to its mesmerizing future picture.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>Skill required</h3>
              <ul>
                <h4><span>Beta Phase</span></h4>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">GUI coding platforms:</mark> C# or other tools for creating GUI application such as Python Tkinter, Python Pyqt, Java, and so forth are required to do this project.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">TensorFlow:</mark> It is a framework for coding <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> algorithms so skills and experience using this tool is required</li>
                <h4><span>Scaling Phase</span></h4>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Blockchain:</mark> knowledge in this field is a must as Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are using this technology to store users' information in a with guaranteed security. Having full control of
                  this breakthrough technology will allow BITAI to stabilize its immunity against cybercrimes.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Security:</mark> Security is a must when it comes to any service with Bitcoin as Blockchain is not enough to fully prevent leakage of users' sensitive data. Therefore, I will build up the skill myself and
                  take consultancy from cyber security experts if possible.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Mobile development</mark> experience in this field would be nice for further scalability of the project. It is not required but a precious skill to have</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Web programming:</mark> experience in this field would be nice for further scalability of the project. It is not required but a precious skill to have</li>
                <h4><span>Ultimate Phase</span></h4>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Cloud Computing:</mark> experience in this field would be nice for further development of the project. After the scaling phase, this project will have to handle an enormously huge user database which will
                  require a reliable information storage. Having a limited knowledge of this field, I could not build a storage system and configure it by myself. Therefore, I will use cloud computing service to help me solve the problem. It is not
                  required but a precious skill to have</li>
                <h4><span>Non-technical skills</span></h4>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Life-long learning:</mark> This skill is a mandatory requirement and a pivotal factor that determines the success of the project. Since technology is always changing, if the project only sticks with the
                  old technologies, it will not be able to keep up with current situation. Therefore, constant lookups for new and efficient technology is a must.</li>
                <li><mark class="normal_mark">Communication skills:</mark> BITAI is a large project, therefore implementing it requires me to collaborate with many other teammates. In order to recruit them, I have to possess social and communication
                  skills to get to know them and then I can pitch my ideas to drag their attentions and interest to the project. Same with life-long learning, this skills is pivotal.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Outcome</h3>
              <p>&emsp;&emsp;If the project is successful with enough positive feedbacks from at least 10000 active users, it will be released to the general public using advertisements on various platforms including: YouTube, Google, Instagram,
                Twitter, etc. From there, if the project achieves more than 50000 active users, I will consider transitioning the project to a web-based service to help more and more Bitcoin investors. At this stage, the project is proven to be a
                truly reliable investing pal to other investors around the world. Having access to effective tools from our project, investors can now enjoy worry-free investments without losing all money like their traditional investing strategies.
                Speaking of positive impacts, this project will simultaneously guarantee users consistently profitable investments and exterminate all the risks of losing money that can leave negative consequences to the Bitcoin investors.</p>

                successful and existing AI crypto bots to learn more about what functionalities and features they offer to their customers. He also suggested me to build a user-friendly GUI because this application's category is quite unique, thus,
                it needs to have a nice design to be able to approach more people. During the interview, he was curious about direct transaction feature (i.e., convert Bitcoin and other crypto coins and send the money directly to the clients' bank
                accounts) and how it could be done it the future. He said: "it would be super useful for many crypto clients to have that feature in BITAI.".</p>

                clarification, she admitted having interest in the project, but she told me that she is uncertain of its success. Moreover, she also warned me of crawling data from Bitcoin website, saying that it is possible, yet difficult to crawl
                large amount of data in long term from the source. In addition to the project idea feedback, she also gave me a detail advise regarding my writing style and then helped me to improve it by pointing out some vague thesis, hypothesis,

            existence of some other potential competitors so I have to work harder and spend more time for this project so as to have a chance of success. Chau Loan, on the other hand, makes me realize the what the BITAI is missing and recognize the
            realistic challenges of project. I will use these as two of the lodestars for developing and improving my project</p>

          <h3>What does it do?</h3>

          </div>
          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p class="idea3-original">&emsp;&emsp;Artificial Intelligence refers to computers/machines whose capability allows them to perform complex tasks that can only be done with human intelligence. The state of the art of Artificial Intelligence relies on one of its word components: <strong>Intelligence</strong>. What is the definition of Intelligence? John McCarthy, the father of AI, has his
            answer for the question, saying: "Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world" <a href="#idea2-destination"><code class="text-bold">[3]</code></a>. Traditionally, computers solve problems by using
            developers and coders' instructions. Nowadays, with the
            help of AI, coders can teach computers how to become an independent thinker with its own Intelligence using algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Neural Network, etc. There are diverse applications of AI in our Vietnamese
            society such as voice,
            image recognition, spam email filtering, AI robot (e.g., Trí Nhân robot from ), AI X-ray Reader.</p>
          <p>AI is classified into 3 levels of intelligence: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark class="normal_mark">Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):</mark> This is also known as a <strong>Weak AI</strong>. Some examples of this type of AI are <strong>Open AI</strong> - an AI bot that dominates even the top
              professional Dota player in 1v1 fights, <strong>DeepBlue</strong> - an AI bot that is capable of beating the world's greatest chess player Garry Kasparov, <strong>Pluribus</strong> - an AI bot that dominates over top professional
              pokers in a six-player game in Texas. All these examples have the same common ground which is its specialization: one AI for solely one field. This common ground is what distinguishes Weak AI from the 2 other higher levels of AI.
              Comparing to human, Weak AI may be the dominant on the spectrum of its specialized area, but other spectrums are too overwhelm for Weak AI's capability.</li>
            <li><mark class="normal_mark">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</mark> This is also known as a <strong>Strong AI</strong>. Strong AI, by definition, can perform with human-level intelligence in any spectrum. In other words, no
              matter if the spectrum relates to politics, education, games, etc., Strong AI's knowledge covers them all. Human knowledge nowadays are insufficient to produce such AI. However, there are some notable attempts trying to reach this
              AI levels such as <strong>Sofia</strong> - a robot whose intelligence allows her to hold the title the first robot citizen in the world and many more similar unofficial versions.</li>
            <li><mark class="normal_mark">Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</mark> This is also known as a <strong>Super AI</strong>. Super AI is superior to Strong AI as it could surpass any existing human in the world in all areas. Having
              this AI, in my opinion, human labour could totally be replaced and the world's future would be unpredictably revolutionized.</li>

          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;ML is one of the greatest applications of Probability and Statistics. Machine Learning uses principles of Probability and Statistics to process and extract the trends of known data (as "knowledge") for predicting future unknown data. For example, a table of columns (name, gender, age, favorite movie type) is fed to a machine learning model where name, gender, and age data are used as the model's column input and favorite movie type is the prediction output of the model. With enough amount of sample data (i.e., training data) given to the model, it will be able to predict what is the favorite movie type of a given set of information (e.g., Name: Bob, gender: Male, Age: 29). The fundamental process of applying
            machine learning includes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Get existing datasets (e.g., from the Internet, Organizations/Companies, etc.) or crawl data from these sources.</li>
            <li>Gather and turn the data into tabular format and perform data cleaning & processing using data manipulation techniques. In a table, some columns are unnecessary so they can be dropped. In some cases, data in desired columns are
              null or not presented in the right format, they have to be fixed before proceeding to the next step.</li>
            <li>Data visualization using processed data from the previous step. In other words, draw charts to present data in a more comprehensive way. Afterwards, identify anomalies and outliers (if exists) in the visualization before heading to the next
              steps.</li>
            <li>Use a set of columns as parameters for the machine learning model to take into account and choose a target column for the model to predict.</li>
            <li>Split data into training and testing with proportion specified (e.g, 70% for training and 30% for testing). Use appropriate pre-built machine learning models or re-build a new/existing one and feed data to these models for
              prediction.</li>
            <li>Use metrics for comparison between the models/algorithms' accuracy of prediction (i.e., compare how accurate the prediction of testing data is with respect to the original data) and choose the algorithm with the highest score.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>

            <p class="col-50">&emsp;&emsp;The adjacent illustration is an interesting analogy between AI and ML, it shows the connections between AI and ML where ML is the described as the brain of AI. This is indeed true because without ML, AI
              cannot perform its function properly due to lacking decision-making process (done by Machine Learning). Therefore, Machine Learning is an important subset of AI.</p>

          <p>&emsp;&emsp;There are so many Machine Learning algorithms, but all of them are usually classified as: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark class="normal_mark">Supervised Learning:</mark> is set of machine learning algorithms for training data with proper labels. For example, data with ascribed values such as gender, name, hobbies, price, and so forth are
              considered labelled data. Some examples of such algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors. Models of this type focus on extracting patterns of data to foresee the future, so
              applications of Supervised Learning includes house price, stock predictions, object & speech recognition, spam detection, etc.</li>
            <li><mark class="normal_mark">Unsupervised Learning:</mark> In contrast with <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>, this category includes a set of machine learning algorithms for unlabelled data. After feeding the data to
              models/algorithms, they will be clustered into separate groups. Some examples of such algorithms are Principle Component Analysis, Apriori Algorithm, Dimensionality Reduction, K-means Clustering. Applications of Unsupervised Learning
              includes Detecting abnormal banking transactions, clients' habits of purchasing, product/service recommendation, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          </li>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;AI & ML has been a help to many sectors in Vietnam such as Economy, Education, Medical, Agriculture, Culinary and more. For the Agriculture, AI & ML have been incorporated in machineries and even drones to turn arid lands into gold fields. For the economy, the applications of AI & ML has notably transformed many traditional to data-driven businesses which leverage the large amount of existing data to ease out the decision-making process. The development of these businesses has been claimed to be significant contributors of the economy of many countries worldwide. For the healthcare sector, many people with disabilities have become more comfortable with AI & ML supporting gears than traditional gears. For instance, hearing aid devices from the past cannot provide enough sensations and detailed sound when compared to AI & ML hearing aid devices. Thus, with AI & ML technologies, lives of people with deafness and hearing loss issues have never been easier.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the next 3 years, I believe that these technologies will be applied in many more fields to help humans achieves ground-breaking miracles. Additionally, since the propaganda has been delivering positive news regarding how marvellous AI is to the general public, there will be more experts getting motivated with this tech. Thus, there will be more collaborations to make AI much more advanced than it is at the moment. As a result, its capability will be much more unpredictable.</p>
          <h3>What is likely the impact?</h3>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The advancement of AI co-exists with the fact that human labours might be replaced in the future. Under the perspective of employers, it will be beneficial for them to have less amount of paycheck and higher productivity.
            Nevertheless, people whose jobs can be replaced by AI will be unemployed or having salary cut-offs. Without supports from the governments, many citizens around the world, in my belief, will have
            financial adversities and more people will become homeless. At the moment, some AI can mimic humans' emotions and accurately predict other people's thinking. A few year later, I believe, AI will become so advanced that jobs which require direct contact with the customers/clients
            such as receptionists, waiters/waitresses, salespersons will be at risks of redundancy. Especially nurses, they could be, as well as other medical assistant jobs, replaced by AI robots in the future.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;Nonetheless, as evidenced by some of the examples above, it is undeniable that AI indeed has an enormous potential that could bring a vast amount of benefits to humankinds. Therefore, many sectors involving AI in Vietnam mentioned above will be more developed in the future. For instance, with the help of AI, operations for some of the deadliest cancers such as lung, breast, pancreatic, prostate cancer could be easily successful in the future where there is no side effect post operation. The lack of educators has been one of the major issues of education in rural areas in Vietnam. What if AI in the future could intervene and resolve the problem by becoming substitutions for those missing educators? While Agriculture in some developed countries has been so productive due to possessing leading AI technology, the sector in underdeveloped countries has undergone many difficulties after years of renovations. Therefore, there are so many hungry people in the world who does not have enough food to eat. In the future, when AI becomes more accessible to all walks of life, I think that food will not a concern for humans.</p>
          <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;As an IT student who have witnessed the power of GitHub Copilot - an AI coding assistant, I hope that some coding-related tools possessing AI in the future will not be too advanced to be able to replace my job. However, AI is
            not totally a threat to me as I can leverage its power to acquire benefit. In particular, I have a vested interest in cryptocurrency, therefore, having support from future AI bots will enable me to simultaneously reduce the work taken for
            each investment decision and gain more profit. With the impact of COVID19, many people have to stay at home. Therefore, AI </p>

          </div>
          <h2>Blockchain</h2>
          <p class="idea3-original">&emsp;&emsp;Blockchain is a one-of-a-kind database where all new data and information are electronically stored in chunks or blocks or a list of records. Each block contains its own hashed address (i.e., encrypted
            address), transaction data (e.g., how much money is sent from the sender to the recipient), and a timestamp denoting when the transaction was performed. There are two types of block, which are <strong>filled</strong> and
            <strong>unfilled</strong>. Filled blocks are saturated of data & information so they will have their own timestamp information and transaction data stored. For flexible backward traversing, Blockchain has these filled blocks chained
            together using links that consists of a hash code for the previous block. If new data comes in and there is no room left for storage, a new block will be formed to contain such data and it will become an unfilled block. Unfilled blocks
            (i.e., new or partially full blocks) are capable of storing more data before becoming a filled block. The process keeps going until the database exceeds the computing and computational power of computers. The state of the art of
            Blockchain is its decentralized architecture and distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. While traditional databases are operated by several centralized servers across the globe and each server requires an extensive number of computers
            (for computing power), Blockchain does not require such servers' locations to store data, and instead, it uses data shared by the P2P network.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;Thanks to its secured data protection mechanism, many governments and organizations are investing more resources to adapt the technology into their systems. Thus, some variations of Blockchain appears with modifications regarding speed
            optimizations, networks, centralization/decentralization, etc. The following figure illustrates 4 different classifications of Blockchain: </p>

          <h3>What is likely the impact?</h3>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The fast development of this technology will revolutionize the way financial institutions & headquarters and the governments store their data. Indeed, it will be more secured and faster than traditional server-based
            databases. On the contrary, having too much access to cryptocurrency may lead to illegal trades of goods, drugs, important documents, service and even humans.</p>

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jeevan - Facebook Data Scientist:</mark> he does Data Science jobs for Facebook. According to Jeevan, data scientists make hypotheses using their prior knowledge of the problem and then they try to evaluate
                how true the hypotheses are using different dataset and methods to process and disseminate the data. Furthermore, he also mentioned that data scientists are pivotal contributors to basketball leagues and teams. He further made an
                example of his friends in California (original word use: Cal) who became data scientists for NBA teams and he described how they helped NBA teams with recruitment (i.e., "value players properly") and player evaluation (i.e., "picking
                the most efficient player") tasks.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Chirag - Airbnb AI & Machine Learning Engineer:</mark> An example of him working in a start-up company called troo.ly was given, saying that his job was to solve problems of sex offenders and drug traffickers using
                data gathered from external sources. Afterwards, he made an example describing what his job is in Airbnb Corp. To be more specific, he uses machine learning to extract information of bad people from news articles and the Internet, then,
                make prediction of "potential candidates" to deter them from the Airbnb platforms. </li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Sherry List - Azure Developer Engagement Lead:</mark> She mentioned her job of a Azure Developer is to find bugs that first appears in the production and figure out where the bugs are located on her team's
                automated pipeline system. When she was asked to describe her main role, she mentioned the task of partitioning big chunks of problems into smaller software components and giving these components to the development team to await for
                solutions. Once these software components are resolved, she needs to work on connecting these solutions together and add a broker command for each component to inform the next component of previous executed commands. </li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jane Lew - Google Software Engineer</mark> She disclosed some information of the healthcare project she and her team were working on. Specifically, the mission of the team and Google, in general, is to unite
                all of the world's healthcare information into a universally accessible and secured platform. Thus, helps enhancing the patients' experience and medical experts' knowledge. She also mentioned some of her team's healthcare-related
                products such as the fire API (for medical health records), DICOM API (for medical imaging records), machine learning solution for healthcare data and so forth.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Gandhar - ZX Security Penetration Tester</mark> He described that, as a Penetration Tester, he has to find security breaches and vulnerabilities of the clients' platforms which could be websites, mobile
                apps, or a cloud infrastructures. The methodology of finding vulnerabilities is, according to him, trying to malfunction features and functionalities of the platform. He further explained that he will make some attempts to perform
                bizarre tasks and leverage the corresponding bizarre responses from the clients' systems to dive deep into the barebone of the issue. All of these methods are apparently identical to what a hacker would normally use. However,
                Penetration Testers are , he said: "good guys" and "ethical hackers". In fact, he would immediately report these issues to his customers to let them be aware and help them mitigate the risks of similar future hacking attempts.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jeevan - Facebook Data Scientist:</mark> During the interview, he admitted that data science is not solo work, so he has to constantly work with other data scientist colleagues to open his perspective, and
                colleagues from other department to be influenced to solve the problem in different ways. He made an example of his current team - Oxygen Delivery at Facebook where he had to work with not only his data scientist colleagues but also
                people from various departments, including Sales, Marketing, Business to maximize users and advertisers' benefits of using advertisements. </li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Chirag - Airbnb AI & Machine Learning Engineer:</mark> When he was asked about what his day-to-day work and teams that he interacts with, he answered that he usually works with his product manager and his
                ops team. Chirag added in that he also works with his ML engineer colleagues (original word use: "fellow engineering colleagues") and teams from other departments to brainstorm the optimal method of getting labelled data.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Sherry List - Azure Developer Engagement Lead</mark> She rarely mentioned who she interacts with during the interview. Some of a few hints have been shown in the video are "the Development team" (i.e., she
                may interact with this team to solve small problems which are splitted from the original big problem), her started communities in Phillipine and Denmark (to be more specific, the community is for sharing and learning from each other
                and it is created to offset the difficulty of her finding learning resources)</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jane Lew - Google Software Engineer</mark> Jane usually interacts with her colleagues and teammates in the morning by having stand-ups. Each person, including Jane, has to let others know what is on his/her
                short-term and long-term to-do list.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Gandhar - ZX Security Penetration Tester</mark> As mentioned above, he interacts with his customers by sending reports of their system's found issues and vulnerabilities. He also referenced the help of his
                project manager whose responsibility is to build an efficient schedule for him and ensure that he can handle numerous projects of different kinds from the clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <h3>Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jeevan - Facebook Data Scientist:</mark> <strong>Not mentioned</strong>. As an alternative, <mark class="normal_mark">Akshaya Asokan, a Tech Journalist at Analytics India Magazine</mark>, answers this
                question specifically using her estimated proportion of each tasks. According to her, while data scientists spend most of their time (60%) on cleaning and organizing data, the rest of the job's portions requires a significantly less
                time such as 19% for collecting data, 9% for machine learning, 4% for improving the algorithm and so forth. </li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Chirag - Airbnb AI & Machine Learning Engineer:</mark> <strong>Not mentioned</strong>. As an alternative, <mark class="normal_mark">Uri Merhav, a Machine Learning engineer at LinkedIn</mark>, answers this
                question specifically. According to him, 80% of his time was spent on working with deep learning frameworks. Additionally, he also mentioned that data cleaning is a tedious task which requires a tons of time to accomplish.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Sherry List - Azure Developer Engagement Lead</mark> Not having enough access to learning resources of her specialty, she spends most of her time learning new knowledge of her area even if she has 20 years of
                experience working in Information Technology.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jane Lew - Google Software Engineer</mark> Most of her time is spent on the afternoon for coding (doing her job) and team meetings (for discussions and project updates).</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Gandhar - ZX Security Penetration Tester</mark> There is no sign of him talking about what specific task will span the most of his time slots. Gandhar only claimed that his work requires him to stay in
                front of his computer all day.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jeevan - Facebook Data Scientist:</mark> A lot of his projects have undefined scopes (i.e., uncertain if it is possible to finish the project on time or impossible to do the project). He made an example of doing a project that is planned to be
                done in weeks or months and he ended up realizing that the project can take years to accomplish. Moreover, one additional challenging aspect is mentioned in the video, which is the adversity of measuring how good basketball players in
                defense position are. </li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Chirag - Airbnb AI & Machine Learning Engineer:</mark> The process of extracting crimes' names from news articles and various web sources to Airbnb blacklist, according to him, is challenging. He explains
                this by providing an example of two different articles titles to show the off-limits of his machine learning model. In fact, while the model can detect the crime's identity from this basic article's title: "Chirag committed a crime in
                Pennsylvania", it cannot identify the same crime from this source's title: "Chirag was last seen in Pennsylvania, he committed a crime there". Another challenging aspect of his job is to get unbiased label data.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Sherry List - Azure Developer Engagement Lead</mark> Her biggest challenge is that she does not have access to the right resources for her job due to working in Phillipine. Even when she went to Denmark, a
                developed nation, she reaffirmed that her access to learning is still insufficient and hard to find.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Jane Lew - Google Software Engineer</mark> When YK, the interviewer, asked Jane whether she had ever experienced the "infamous" <strong>imposter syndrome</strong> (also known as the syndrome of individuals who constantly
                doubt their abilities, skills and knowledge no matter how good they are) that many Google employees have while working at Google, she said yes. She described her anxiety of not having sufficient contribution to Google when she first
                and officially landed a job at Google.</li>
              <li><mark class="normal_mark">Gandhar - ZX Security Penetration Tester</mark> He pointed out some of the challenges he face during his working hour such as physical exhaustion & fatigueness (due to working overtime), learning too many
                new things for each of the assigned projects. The most challenging, he emphasized, is the vast amount of technical knowledge required for breaking down the systems. This is because some of the customers' infrastructures have a firewall
                system incorporated, the breaking tasks can be halted due to the firewall's blockage. To deal with this hardship, he recommended viewers to "have that gut to just keep going".</li>
